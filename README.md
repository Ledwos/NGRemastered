As the title suggests, this is a reworking of the original project [NewsGame](https://github.com/Ledwos/NewsGameProject).
<br />
<br />
The project itself is a 2D JavaScript game with the intent of encouraging younger audiences to read the news.

It was fun developing this app in collaboration with [Christopher](https://github.com/seekingcode18) so instead of letting it disappear into the git ether, the aim is to make a deployable version allowing <b>you</b> to see it for yourself!
